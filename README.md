### 📌 Project Overview  
SmartWasteAI is a **Computer Vision-based Waste Segregation System** designed for **smart cities**.  
The system:  
- Classifies waste images into categories like *plastic, glass, battery, biological, clothes, paper, etc.*  
- Groups them into **Biodegradable, Recyclable, or Hazardous**.  
- Recommends the correct **color-coded bin**:  
  - ✅ Green → Biodegradable  
  - ✅ Blue → Recyclable  
  - ✅ Red → Hazardous  
- Provides **confidence scores** for predictions.  
- Offers a clean, interactive **Streamlit web interface**.  

This project helps reduce landfill waste, improves recycling rates, and supports sustainable smart cities.
